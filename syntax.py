# Python syntax

# Indentation, a way for Python to know when the code is a part of a certain block.
# For example:
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
#   ^
#   ^
#   Notice these spaces? these tell our Python interpreter that the ``print()`` function
#   should only run if the above statement evaluates to True

# Syntax error
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
